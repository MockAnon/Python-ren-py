Act 1: Like me, for me.
They say the royal crown shines brilliantly, majestically. Like a beacon of Hope to all. A beacon of hope
to everyone within the kingdom of Parchment. A sign of hope which is to only be bestowed upon those
worthy enough to bear its weight, the royal family. The king, queen, and princess of the kingdom of
Parchment. &quot;That&#39;s me!&quot;
The princess wore the crown proudly, she was a child entitled by her birth right. She only wore the finest
clothing, ate the fanciest of foods, and could only associate with the elite. Unfortunately that became
her greatest obstacle; there wasn&#39;t anyone elite enough to actually dine with her. Aside from her
parents of course. &quot;hii&quot; Making dinner time quite lonely. &quot;Very lonely indeed&quot; &quot;oh&quot;
Of course, the court was filled with many different folks from all social standings, but no one was quite
right for her. The lower class was an interesting lot, constantly joking &quot;Surely you jest&quot; and doing things
that captured her attention. &quot;Oh my&quot; Unfortunately they weren&#39;t an option due to their social standing
&quot;bye-bye&quot;. The upper-class was considered worthy of her time, but they honestly weren&#39;t. They were a
collection of bland, stuck up fellows that could best be described as boring. &quot;Shoo you&quot;
One group was interesting, the other worthy. Each party lacked what the other had. Well that, and
colour. Unlike the Princess and the rest of the royal family, everyone else lacked colour, which made
them seem quite dull.&quot;quite dull indeed.&quot;
&quot;Ah ha! That&#39;s it.&quot; Clearly, their absence of colour could only mean one thing: no one here was right for
her, but someplace, somewhere, there had to be someone: &quot;like me, for me&quot; Exactly! The princess
decided that she was going to find that person, worthy enough to dine with her. And she&#39;d start by
exploring the outer regions of the kingdom of Parchment, but first she would take a well-earned nap:
&quot;just a tintsy reward for my noggin. You know, for all the thinking it&#39;s done.&quot;
