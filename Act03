Act 3: Lost and Found
1. Our poor, poor little princess, a lack of a crown meant a lack of colour; and more importantly, a lack
of prestige. What was she to do without her crown (-what indeed-), and more importantly where
was she? Oh my, I&#39;m the narrator and I don&#39;t even know where you are... (-what? Oh my, oh no. No.
No. No.... ) Our lost princess was worried, very, very worried. &quot;wait!&quot; That&#39;s when she noticed it. Off
in the distance there was billowing smoke, and where there is smoke there must be... &quot;people&quot; or
fire. Either way I&#39;m sure it&#39;s worth checking out.
2. Drawing closer she could see shadows dancing in the distance. &quot;Who.... Or what are they?&quot; They
danced madly around the fire, yelling strange things like: &quot;grow&quot; &quot;lah&quot; “Hummus” “Yuck” They
wore masks brimming with colour, more so than even the royalty. &quot;How terrifying.... How terrifying
indeed&quot; Fear filled her mind as her thoughts darted every which way and that. These strangers
beyond the wall, what horrors could they be capable of? Suddenly the music stopped, &quot;pipe down
you silly bear&quot; “I didn’t say anything” and one by one the masked figures began to turn towards
them. Our princess bravely faced her fears, glaring back at the masked beings, but as they drew

closer her fear began to multiply. Soon she was too afraid to face them; closing her eyes, but still,
she refused to run.
3. A tingle went down her spine as she felt someone&#39;s hand touch her own. The music started again
and suddenly someone pulled her forward. She opened her eyes, revealing the reality which she
least expected. The masked ones, they weren&#39;t hurting her, instead, they were dancing. She stood
there awe struck. All they wanted was to dance? That&#39;s it. If there was a time to get her groove on,
it was now. They all dancing, prancing, twisting and twirling below the night sky until they became
exhausted. Quite literally, dancing until they dropped.
4. The following morning the tide came in. Waking our protagonist with a splash, smearing her ink.
&quot;what the? Were we always beside the ocean.&quot; the morning sun beamed down and there was a pile
of smoking ash where the fire once stood. Her new friends where already awake, packing up.
That&#39;s when she had an idea: &quot;they are both colourful and interesting; maybe amongst them I can
find someone worthy enough to be my friend.&quot;So she began her search. Yes, they all had colour. Yes
they all were interesting. Yes, they all met her previous requirements, but now she wanted more.
Perhaps someone more around her own age, maybe someone a tad more interesting, and
preferably someone perfect. One was too plump, another too large, too small, too creepy, too
plain, too everything… Was she being too picky? No, no. Of course not, why would she ever
consider such a concept. &quot;me too picky, oh, no no no. I just refuse to settle.&quot; there was just
something missing about all her options.
5. The strangers were packing up to leave. Teddy was talking with them. Frustrated the princess
stomped off in search of that special someone, her perfect friend. &quot;Hey, wait! They are going in our
direction anyway&quot; She wandered and wandered, until she was very lost. &quot;I honestly couldn&#39;t be any
more lost&quot; it was a little scary, aright, very scary. Especially that thing or there, or that, or what that
thing is right behind you! Fortunately she was very brave quelling her fears. Searching and searching
until she eventually bumped her head &quot;owe&quot;
